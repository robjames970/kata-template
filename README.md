# kata-template
A typescript template for completing katas with tdd
#Using the template
Fork this repository then inside src you can create a new folder for each kata. Suggested naming convetion is 
to use the name of the kata and the name of the kata plus test for the test file. So for FizzBuzz you might 
have fizz-buzz.ts and fizz-buzz.test.ts.

# Running the tests
`npm test` will run all tests that have not been skipped.
